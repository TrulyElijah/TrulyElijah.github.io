  <h1>Elijah Alexandre</h1>
  <h2>Computer Science</h2>
  <h2><img src="img1.heic" width="700" height="700" alt=""></h2>
  <p>
      I'm a Computer Science student at Ursinus College (Class of 2026) with a strong foundation in software development, data structures, and web technologies. I bring a hands-on approach to learning, sharpened through academic projects and real-world experiences. From developing a UI/UX-focused web prototype to performing Data Analysis on Amazon Product ratings from the last 25 years, these experiences have strengthened my skills tremendously.
      My interests lie at the intersection of software engineering, data analysis, and systems programming. I've worked in fast-paced, team-driven environments,from leading warehouse teams to conducting equity research for UCIMCO,and I thrive on solving complex problems collaboratively.
